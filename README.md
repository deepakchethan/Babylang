# Babylang
  
Putting my own spin on some of my favorite estoeric languages brainf*ck and COW, I came up with the grand BabyLang with 9 amazing instructions. The interpreter is written in C++ (Cause, Why not?). It is basic, cause the best things in life are basic. It is esoteric for a reason. 
  
## Commands

| Instruction   | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| gugu | Moves current memory position back one block.       |
| gaga | Moves current memory position forward one block.        |
| unga | Resets the current memory block. It replaces any value with 0. |
| uuug |	Decrement current memory block value by 1. |
| aaag |	Increment current memory block value by 1. |
| gaaa | Take user input and store it in the current memory block |
| guuu |	Print the current memory blocks content to the stdout |
| gagu |	Marks the beginning of the loop. It considers the current memory block's value as the flag to loop through the code. It keeps looping until that value is zero. |
| guga |	Marks the end of the loop. Absence of it after gagu will result in an error.   |
